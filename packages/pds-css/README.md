# PDS CSS

**PDS CSS** aims to provide a _very_ flexible (s)css foundation that can be used to further extend and integrate on.
While most use cases are satisfied with the _prebuilt_ css files included within any package distribution, you'll
probably find yourself in a situation where you need to customize or extend upon existing (PDS) specifications.

## Installation

```
npm i @vitagroup/pds-css
```

## Usage
