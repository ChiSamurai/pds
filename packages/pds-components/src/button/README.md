# Buttons

There are no specific button modules for the default look and feel of buttons. Since the html 5 spec
already provides us with a `<button>` element, there's no necessity to create a separate one. Regular
button variants are applied using pure styling.

## Floating Action Buttons

There is a module definition for floating action buttons thought, due to the additional "floating"
functionality part of the component.

```typescript
import { PdsFabModule } from '@vitagroup/pds-components';
```
