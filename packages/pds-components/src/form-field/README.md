# Form Field

These container components are rather simple structures that may only project their inner content for proper positioning. At a later point thus might also be used as entry point for a more sophisticated form control status handling (e.g. integrating the `form-error-outlet` functionality).

```html
<pds-form-field>
  <pds-text-box></pds-text-box>
</pds-form-field>
```

```html
<pds-form-field>
  <label>Name</label>
  <pds-text-box></pds-text-box>
</pds-form-field>
```
